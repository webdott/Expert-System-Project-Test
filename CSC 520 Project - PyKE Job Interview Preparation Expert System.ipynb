    "A very simple set of code has been provided as template for how to create your own backward chaining expert system.  Specifically this system recommends possible questions to prepare with depeneding on what role you are applying for (for this project's scope, we have limited it to Software engineering, data science, or nothing). This in the folder 'simple_job_questions'. Follow the instructions below:\n",
    "- Unzip this folder and copy it into your working directory.  \n",
    "- Examine 'job_interview_rules.krb' in a text or python editor.\n",
    "    - Each of the code chunks represent backward chaining rules\n",
    "    - Syntax of a PyKE rule:\n",
    "        - The first line gives a unique rule name\n",
    "        - The next line is the 'THEN' part of the rule, designated by the word 'use'.\n",
    "        - The next third line is the 'IF' part of the rule, designated by the word 'when'.\n",
    "            - Each subsequent line is an 'IF' condition that must be satified for the 'THEN' part of the rule to be satisfied.\n",
    "            \n",
    "- Examine 'job_interview.py' in a text or python editor.\n",
    "    - This code initializes the PyKE engine, and includes a function, 'job_interview_test', to run the expert system.\n",
    "- Edit the path (in the sys.path.append()) to the 'simple_job_questions' folder, to match the folder hierarchy on your computer.\n",
